# FundMe
This is my assignment Project from the solidity smart development course, I am following from Cyfrin updraft 

#Description:

For this project, we will be using two contracts: FundMe, the main crowdfunding contract, and PriceConverter. 
They function much like Kickstarter, allowing users to send any native blockchain cryptocurrency. 
They also enable the owner of the contract to withdraw all the funds collected. We will then deploy these contracts on a testnet.
